Read about how I personally get things done.

From the perspective of building [decent.social](https://decent.social).

Showing you the process of how I got [decent.social](https://decent.social) from **landing page**, **to 36 subscribers mailing list** to **MVP** ready. *In two weeks*

I start with a blank piece of paper.

Fold it in half. You have two columns.

Divide these two columns further, by category / topic.

The categories I found useful for [decent.social](https://decent.social) where:

- marketing
- content marketing
- design
- copy
- code
- launches
- social

Here are two examples for the Plannings of the weeks 40 and 41

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="/img/blog/gtd-week-40.jpg">
      <img src="/img/blog/gtd-week-40.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    </a>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="/img/blog/gtd-week-41.jpg">
      <img src="/img/blog/gtd-week-41.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    </a>
  </div>
</div>

Put down whatever crosses your mind, **at all times during the day**, in the categories you have defined.

The idea is to have this weekly planning at your hands whenever you need it.

## Visibility

On a sheet of paper I can clearly scan and evaluate my next most important step to take.

Most important in terms of priority, which is up to you.

You have a perfect overview of the week.

## Analogue

Since it isn't a Trello board or similar, on which you attach files, comment, tag and much more.

Of course it makes even more sense if you're in a (distributed) team, for collaboration at work.

But for personal use, perfectly for side-projects, I find it's pretty neat and functional.

You can also use it as a weekly journal for your project.

## Limited space

On a sheet of paper you're limited to the size of it, and your handwriting.

That's it. For a week. For a sprint.

You cannot do **that much more**.

It reminds you also to chill out while brainstorming.

The flood of ideas you get needs to be first validated.

While writing down the next taks, you might already found a leaner way to achieve the same.

This to save precious space on the sheet of paper.

## Weekly planning

This is how I planned the past two weeks for the product development of [decent.social](https://decent.social)
