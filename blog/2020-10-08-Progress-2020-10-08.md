Today 1 person subscribed to the newsletter (yesterday 2), which brings it to 36!

16 people left and I will continue working on Decent!

I got the authentication working for the MVP.

Using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) + express + mongo (+ redis) on the backend.

[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) + bootstrap on the frontend
