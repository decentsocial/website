### Timeline browsing and single status 

This is the current experience when deep diving in a tweet.

Just click on it an view in in an expanded fashion:

<video controls autoPlay loop class='img-fluid mt-5'>
  <source src='https://decent.social/video/app.decent.social-single-status.mp4' type='video/mp4' />
  <source src='https://decent.social/video/app.decent.social-single-status.webm' type='video/webm' />
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
    a <a href='https://decent.social/video/app.decent.social-single-status.mp4'>link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>

One thing that I noticed is that if you navigate back to the homepage, the previous timeline position is lost.

Quite unfortunate, have to find a solution for it.
