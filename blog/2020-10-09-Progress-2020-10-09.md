I have a Minimal Viable Product for Decent!

On sunday I will write to the subscribers that the beta has officially started.

The app can already be used here (for free now)

[app.decent.social](https://app.decent.social/)

Today I spent some time to connect the dots between `decent-social-cli` and the server.

New routes on the API side

- GET /user/info
- GET /user/timeline
- GET /user/settings
- PATCH /user/settings
- GET /api/following/:username
- GET /auth/login
- GET /auth/callback
- GET /auth/logout

The client is written in preact.

Virtual scroll has been implemented for the timeline (it was too sluggish rendering all items).
