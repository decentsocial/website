Today I posted [decent.social](https://decent.social) on the sub-reddit [/r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/j4wb3h/a_privacyfriendly_decent_twitter_reader/).

It resulted in **100+ unique visitors** and **4 subscribers** to the mailing list.

Now the mailing list includes 19 people!

In the next days I plan to send out a newsletter with updates, and asking for feedback and ideas the current subscribers could have about Decent.

The newsletter will contain a link to the blog post about [Notes on “I've got nothing to hide”](/blog/2020-10-02-Notes-on-I-have-got-nothing-to-hide/).

Almost forgot, on Monday I am going to post the above article to HackerNews and Reddit!

Let's see how it goes and what feedback I'll receive.
