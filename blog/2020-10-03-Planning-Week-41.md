Today I am going to post this article to HackerNews and Reddit

[Notes on “I've got nothing to hide”](/blog/2020-10-02-Notes-on-I-have-got-nothing-to-hide/).

Let's see how it goes and what feedback I'll receive.

In the next days I'll work on a MVP for the Decent.social web client!

If you have feedback about it, reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/christian_fei" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.

People that are currently subscribed will have access to the beta.

I still need to receive feedback on the overall Design of Decent.social from a few friends of mine.
