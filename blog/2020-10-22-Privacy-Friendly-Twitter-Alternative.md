[Decent.social](https://decent.social) is a privacy-friendly Twitter Alternative.

It allows you to create your private Twitter timeline, without advertisement, targeted ads and profiling of your activity.

[Decent App](https://app.decent.social) uses Nitter behind the scenes to retrieve Tweets of users you are following.

Decent gives you the opportunity to escape tracking and analysis of your interests, for a more private Twitter reading experience.

## Simple, private timeline

Instead of presenting you a bloated Twitter timeline filled with advertisiment, "Tweets you might like" and other "optimiziations", Decent tries to respect your attention and privacy.

Decent is the simplest Twitter client, that respects you.

## Open-source

Decent is [open-source](github.com/decentsocial) and is available on GitHub.

You have the option to self-host it if you want, and take back control over your data and privacy.

## Pleasant User Experience

Decent focuses on speed and privacy.

The accounts you follow remain secure in our database and **no information ever** is analyzed to present you ads and other accounts you could be interested in.

While using Decent you can be 100% certain that your data (preferences, interactions, etc.) are private and **will never be shared with anyone or analysed**, ever.

## Lightweight

Twitter is a bloated web application, with countless so called "optimizations" for your timeline that destroy your Twitter reading experience.

When reading your Twitter feed, you can rest assured that it's only you that is seeing what you're seeing. No analysis or optimizations are made based on your activity and interactions.

It also loads almost instanly, by caching and diffing the latest tweets. For a pleasant, fast and lightweight experience.

## Adblockers NOT needed

Since [Decent](https://app.decent.social) doesn't show ads, you don't have to worry about third party cookies and tracking across the internet.

You can still use an Adblocker, but it won't be needed since there is nothing to block :)

## Why is Decent not free like Twitter?

Why is Twitter free? That is because it collects and analyzes extreme amounts of data and personal information from their users. This data is then used to sell advertisement, based on your behaviour and preferences.

Decent has a different business model.

**You are the user on Decent**

**On Twitter, you are being used**

No personal data is being collected and analyzed. 

With Decent, your data is not being shared with or sold to third-parties.

Decent needs to charge a fee to stay alive and continue providing a privacy-friendly service.

## Decent is a great Twitter alternative

Why? Because if you care about your privacy, using Twitter is not feasible.

Your data is constantly being collected, analyzed and sold.

On Decent nothing of this kind happens behind the scenes, and we are [transparent about it](https://github.com/decentsocial). You can see the source-code yourself.

Decent is 10 times faster and lightweight than Twitter.

Your privacy is respected and you can be free to browse Decent with the knowledge that your actions and behaviour is of no interest for us. 

We care about Privacy, and thus our users' Privacy.

Twitter is free because it doesn't care about your privacy, and uses you to optimize your behaviour to improve ad impressions and sales.
