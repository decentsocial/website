          <b>What's wrong with Twitter?</b>
          <br>
          Twitter's business model is based on <b>advertisement and targeting</b>, by collecting your <b>personal information, behaviour and preferences</b>.
          <br>
          This information is used to present you the timeline mixed with <b>promoted tweets and advertisement</b>.
          <br>
          That's how Twitter can be "free", but you shouldn't fall for it.

          <b>Why is Decent not free like Twitter?</b>
          <br>
          You pay for reading your Decent timeline knowing you're not being tracked, profiled and presented with "tweets you might like".
          <br>
          With Decent <b>you are using a service</b>, <b>not being used by it</b>.
          <br>
          No information at all is collected and you're not being targeted or manipulated.
          <br>
          <b>Decent doesn't show ads or sells your information, that's why we need to ask a small fee.</b>

          <b>I would like self-host Decent, can I?</b>
          <br>
          Yes! Decent's idea is to be fully transparent and open-source, thus you can <a href="https://github.com/decentsocial" target="_blank">check out the code on GitHub</a> and decide to host it on your own.
          <br>
          You'll have to install, host and manage Decent yourself on your own server or PC.

          <b>Why is my privacy important when browsing Twitter?</b>
          <br>
          Privacy is a vast term and refers to many small but important information collected and misused without our consent.
          <br>
          This is why protecting yourself from fingerprinting, analysis and "optimization" based on your past behaviour.
          <br>
          Think of "Promoted Tweets" or simply advertisement you see on your Twitter timeline.
          <br>
          Recently I stumbled upon this paper about “I've Got Nothing to Hide” and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy by Daniel J. Solove
          <br>
